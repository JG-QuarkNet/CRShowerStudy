The next number is the time at which the pulse fell back below the threshold, called the **falling edge**.  Although the header line indicates that these values are given in seconds, they are actually measured as the fraction of the day that has passed since the DAQ's day clock rolled over, typically around midnight.  Thus, 0.2452114384916088 is about a quarter of the way through the day, or a little before 6:00 AM (it's actually 5:53:06 and change).  These values are precise to within a tenth of a nanosecond.\n",
